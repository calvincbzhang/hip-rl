# HIP-RL: Hallucinated Inputs Preference-based Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains the implementation of the HIP-RL algorithm. The HIP-RL algorithm uses hallucinted inputs to directly control the epistemic uncertainty, enabling optimistic exploration in Prefenrence-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) problems in continuous state-action spaces.

A short demo of the results can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/view/hip-rl/).
